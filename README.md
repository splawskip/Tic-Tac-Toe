# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a classic two-player board game where players take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with three of their marks before the opponent does.

The game interface is designed using vanilla CSS (following the BEM naming convention) to provide a clean and intuitive user experience. The board consists of nine squares arranged in a 3x3 grid. Each square initially has no mark and can be clicked by the players to place their X or O.

The game logic is implemented using vanilla JS, which handles the interaction between the players and updates the game state accordingly. When a player clicks on an empty square, the corresponding mark is placed, and the turn switches to the other player. The game checks for a winning condition after each move to determine if a player has won or if the game has ended in a draw.

If a winning condition is met, the game displays a message declaring the winner and allows the players to start a new game. In the case of a draw, a message is displayed indicating the tie. The players can then reset the game to play again.

The game also includes some additional features to enhance the gameplay experience. It keeps track of the number of wins for each player and updates the score accordingly. The current player's turn is visually highlighted to provide clarity during the game. Additionally, a reset button is provided to allow the players to restart the game at any time.

Overall, this Tic-Tac-Toe game, created using vanilla JS and vanilla CSS, provides an enjoyable and interactive gaming experience for two players, bringing the timeless fun of the classic game to the digital realm.

***Oh, I forgot, we throw confetti when some player wins! When there is a tie, we throw the boring one.*** Thanks to ðŸ‘‰ [JS Confetti](https://github.com/loonywizard/js-confetti)
